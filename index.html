							<h1>About the Conference</h1>
						</div>
	
						<p>
							The annual <a href="http://www.r-project.org/conferences.html">useR!</a> international R User conference is the main meeting of the <a
								href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> user and developer community. Its program consists of both invited and user-contributed
							presentations:
						</p>
	
	
	
						<ul>
							<li>The invited keynote lectures cover a broad spectrum of topics ranging from technical and R-related computing issues to
								general statistical topics of current interest.</li>
							<li>The user-contributed presentations are submitted as abstracts prior to the conference and may be related to (virtually) any
								R-related topic. The presentations are typically organized in sessions of either broad or special interest, which also comprise a
								"free" discussion format. Such a discussion format not only provides a forum for software demonstrations and detailed discussions but
								also supports the self-organization of the respective communities.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>The registration page allows for both purchasing conference tickets as well as (optional) on-campus housing within a single order. Tutorials are included with the conference ticket!</p>

						<h4>Campus housing</h4>

						<p> UCLA has made a limited number of on-campus dormitories available for conference guests to stay. These rooms can be purchased on a per-night basis along with the conference ticket. Two options are available: a <b>single (private) room</b> costs $134.00 per night, whereas a <b>double (shared) room</b> is $87.00 per night. When choosing a double room, the registration form will ask to name another conference visitor that you will be sharing the room with. We expect guests that wish to share a room will take initiave in finding a room mate, but the organizing committee can provide some assistance if needed.</p>

						<p> When purchasing on-campus housing, <b><span class="text-error">please double check that the value in the "Number of Nights" dropdown menu matches the number of selected checkboxes</span></b>. Unfortunately the form of our vendor does not seem to verify this and only charges for the number of nights that were selected in the dropdown menu. This is a bit confusing but beyond our control. Obviously you can only stay as many nights as you purchased :-)</p>

						<div class="text-center">
							<img class="img-polaroid" id="regscreenshot" src="images/screenshot_small.png" alt="Screenshot of registration page" />
						</div>

						<h4>Paying by business check</h4>

If our office does not receive a valid check for payment in full before 6/1/14 or if it is dishonored in any way then your registration will be canceled without notice. Full payment of all charges is required; payment of some charges but not others using this method is not permitted. The check must be made out in US dollars only to "Regents of the University of California" with memo field stating "UseR!2014 registration for __your name___" and receipt number. The mailing address is UCLA Department of Statistics attn. J Valenzuela, Box 951554, 8125 Math Sciences Building, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1554 USA.

						<p>The opening evening of the Conference, June 30, will feature an outdoor wine and hors d'oeuvres <i>reception</i>. This is your opportunity to mingle with with be a very broad international representation of R users of all stripes and sizes and to meet the conference speakers and members of the Program Committee and Organizing Committee for one-on-one conversation. There is no additional charge for this reception though you must be registered to be admitted. </p>

						<p>The <i>Conference Banquet</i> is scheduled for the evening of July 2. It will be an outdoor catered event within close walking distance of the Conference Center. This event has an additional charge for each attendee in addition to the Conference registration fees, but is open to family members and children. More details about this Banquet, and the menu, will be posted here shortly.</p>

						<p>Planning is moving ahead at this moment for a *special event for women attendees* of the Conference, specifically to allow female R developers to get connected and learn about each other's programming work. Watch this space closely for further announcements.</p>

						<p><i>If</i> you have an interest in hosting a particular social event during the Conference, kindly contact the Organizing Committee with details at dmca[at]ucla.edu as soon as possible. We will attempt to accommodate all requests, though certain restrictions apply. Each event will be described in this space as they are confirmed. Do watch this space closely.</p>


						<h3>Dining in Los Angeles</h3>
						<p>The number of full service restaurants in the Los Angeles area is close to 10,000, representing many hundreds of different food styles. Regrettably, you probably won’t have enough time to savor them all. If you’re interested in sampling something you’ve never had the opportunity to sample before or just missing your favorite dish, it is highly likely that a particular gastronomic fare will be available somewhere in the area. There are many internet resources providing detailed advice on this matter, often with exact menus, prices and photos: search the keyword phrase “Los Angeles restaurant guide” for starters. </p>


						<h3>Major attractions for the family</h3>
						<p>Los Angeles is world-renowned for its wealth of entertainment. This website cannot begin to do justice to the extraordinary range of good things available in this area. Readers are encouraged to search the many internet resources devoted to this topic: for example, try the keyword phrases such as “Los Angeles attractions” and “Los Angeles free events” </p>

						<p>Just a short walk from the Conference Center, UCLA is the home of the renowned <a href="http://www.fmch.ucla.edu">Fowler Museum</a>, exploring global arts and cultures with an emphasis on works from Africa, Asia, the Pacific, and the Americas—past and present. Admission is free though the Museum is closed Mondays and Tuesdays.</p>

						<p>A few minutes walk further into the adjacent community of Westwood is the <a href="http://hammer.ucla.edu">Hammer Museum</a>, a world-class unique, cutting-edge arts institution that connects the classics and the contemporary through its varied collections, wide-ranging exhibitions, and provocative programs. Admission is free though the Museum is closed Mondays. </p>

						<p>Close to the UCLA campus is the world-famous <a href="http://www.getty.edu">J. Paul Getty Museum</a> at the Getty Center, which houses European paintings, drawings, sculpture, illuminated manuscripts, decorative arts, and European and American photographs in a spectacular architectural setting. Admission is free though the Museum is closed Mondays. </p>

						<p>Conference staff will be delighted to provide campus maps, area maps and advice about attractions in the immediate area and across the greater Los Angeles basin. Our Conference Services desk will be staffed full-time during the Conference, in the main foyer of Carnesale Commons.</p>

						<p>In 2014, the conference will be held in Los Angeles, at the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA). Los Angeles is the second most populous city in the United States, following New York City. UCLA was one of two original public universities in California, following UC Berkeley. It's a large university campus, with about 40,000 students (30,000 undergraduates, 10,000 graduate students) and 4,000 faculty members. Because of its location in Los Angeles, UCLA has been featured many times in movies and TV shows. UCLA is located approximately seven miles from the Pacific ocean, and eight miles from Hollywood.</p>

						<h3>Weather forecast</h3>
						<p>The average temperature in the immediate vicinity during the conference is expected to be a very comfortable 73 degrees Fahrenheit (23 degrees Celsius). Elsewhere across greater Los Angeles during the same period we anticipate 79 degrees Fahrenheit (26 degrees Celsius). Daylight lasts 14.5 hrs (sun screen is recommended when you are out of doors). Evenings will cool to about 63 F (17 C). Light jackets or sweaters should be more than adequate at nighttime.</p>

						<p>Though weather world-wide has lately been unsettled, we can state that the average probability of precipitation during the Conference is estimated to be a mere 4%. The relative humidity typically is mildly humid, rarely dropping below 48% (comfortable), or exceeding 95% (very humid). Typical wind speeds vary from 0 mph to 14 mph (calm to moderate breeze). </p>

						<h3>Recreation</h3>
						<p>Included with your paid Conference registration is admission on an individual basis to all UCLA campus recreation facilities. The <a href="http://www.recreation.ucla.edu/jwc">John Wooden Center</a> and <a href="http://www.recreation.ucla.edu/sunsetcanyonrecreationcenter">Sunset Canyon Recreation Center</a> include swimming pools, weight rooms, tennis courts, racquetball courts and handball courts. </p>		


						<h3>Parking</h3>
						<p>Parking permits are required at all times for all vehicles parked on campus. The fee is USD 12.00 per vehicle per day. Vehicles without permits are subject to ticketing and towing. You may purchase parking permits at a campus parking kiosk upon arrival.</p>					

						<h3>Smoking policy</h3>
						<p>UCLA is a <b>non-smoking environment</b>. Use of cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco and all other tobacco products including electronic cigarettes is prohibited on UCLA's campus and at sites owned or leased by the university. "Tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke remain the leading causes of preventable disease and death worldwide," the UCLA Chancellor has noted in an open letter about this recent policy change. UCLA joins with hundreds of colleges and universities nationwide that have adopted tobacco-free or smoke-free policies. </p>

						<h3>Alcohol policy</h3>
						<p>All participants shall abide by University laws and policies concerning possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages. Possession of open or visible containers anywhere except within an assigned room where the door is closed (for those guests older than 21 years of age) or at a UCLA catered event is strictly prohibited. All regulations governing controlled substances and possession of paraphernalia for intended or implied use of controlled substances are observed in full.</p>

						<h3>Harassment policy</h3>
						<p>UseR!2014 at UCLA is dedicated to providing a conference free from harassment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.  We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.  Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.  Sexual language or imagery is not appropriate for talks, posters, exhibitors’ displays, or social and dining events.  Violators may be sanctioned, including being expelled from the conference without a refund, at the complete discretion of the Conference Organizing Committee.  For more information, resources, and official policy concerning this topic, see <a href="http://www.sexualharassment.ucla.edu/">the UCLA website</a>.</p>

						<p>UCLA offers modern rooms featuring air-conditioning, cable TV, complimentary wireless high-speed Internet connections, in-room telephone, two twin beds, a private or shared bathroom between two rooms, and daily maid service. The accommodations are conveniently located adjacent to meeting rooms and large dining facilities. There are 24-hour front desk services for check-in, messages, and information. All rooms are non-smoking. A designated number of sleeping rooms also meet Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements.</p>

						<p>Acceptable rooms for persons with disabilities will be provided at the same cost as those rooms contracted for by the Conference. To ensure that specific rooms are provided, please send an email before 6/9/14 to  dmca[at]ucla.edu  describing the needs of any participants with disabilities so that UCLA Conference Services can be informed. The Conference Organizers' obligation is to make certain that the program is conducted in such a manner that it is accessible to all persons with disabilities.</p>

						<p>Guests who bring their own computer/laptop can access the Internet directly via the Ethernet port in their sleeping rooms.  In order to access the Internet, guests must have the Ethernet card on their computer software.  If guests do not have their own Ethernet card, they can purchase one through the Covel Business Center located directly across from Sunset Village.   Each sleeping room is equipped with a telephone that allows complimentary access to UCLA campus extensions, with complimentary access to local calls within a certain radius of the campus. To make local and long distance calls, guests must use a prepaid telephone calling card.  Phone cards are available for sale at the front desk of each residential facility</p>						

						<p>All accommodations are sold on a “package plan” basis and include rooms, daily meals, and use of UCLA’s Olympic-quality recreational facilities. Meals are all-you-care-to-eat.  The University of California Los Angeles is a smoke-free facility.</p>

						<h3>Nearby Hotels</h3>

						<p>Discounted conference rates have been negotiated with several high-quality hotels in the Westwood area including the following:</p>

						<ul>
							<li><a href="http://luxesunset.com">Luxe Sunset Boulevard Hotel</a>: Special conference pricing of $185 for a Superior room, $229 for a suite. Parking is $18; shuttle service will be available.  Distance from conference = 1.2 miles, difficult for pedestrians due to hills and street traffic.</li>

							<li><a href="http://www.hotelangeleno.com">Hotel Angeleno</a>: Special conference pricing of $159 single or double occupancy. Complimentary parking and shuttle. Distance from conference = 1.3 miles, difficult for pedestrians due to hills and street traffic.</li>

							<li><a href="http://www.royalpalacewestwood.com">Royal Palace Westwood</a> Special conference pricing of $159 for single queen bed, $169 for single king bed, $179 for two beds. Free parking, no shuttle service. Distance from conference = 1.4 miles, moderately strenuous for pedestrians due to hills and construction.</li>

						</ul> 

						<p>If you choose to reserve a room at one of these fine facilities, do call their offices directly as the internet pricing may or may not reflect the discounted conference rate.  All of the above rates are subject to a 14% hotel room tax, as are all hotels and motels in this area.</p>

						<p>Should you choose to stay at one of these establishments or any of several dozen others in the Westwood, Santa Monica, Culver City or Beverly Hills areas which surround the UCLA campus, please exercise care when mapping your overall itinerary as the patterns of traffic in this hilly area can be famously demanding.  This is especially true during rush-hour which happens to extend over a pair of several-hour-long periods each day.  What may appear as an easy jaunt on a map of the area in two dimensions can pose unexpected challenges to the unwary.  The UCLA campus is currently undergoing substantial construction and even the most current maps may not show necessary walking and driving detours.  Do also note that daytime parking at the Conference will be charged, that meals are available for purchase at the Conference Center through their meal ticket system (all meal tickets purchased on an individual basis are subject to the 9% California Sales Tax).  Numerous restaurants can found throughout the region, and many other amenities are available in both the immediate vicinity and across the greater Los Angeles area.  If this is your first visit to Los Angeles, do explore local travel agents in your hometown as well as the internet for further information.</p>

							<h1>Travel Information</h1>
						</div>
							<p>The most convenient airport for accessing UCLA is the <a href="http://www.lawa.org/welcomelax.aspx">Los Angeles International Airport</a> (LAX).	From LAX, a variety of transit options are available. For $10 may we recommend the <a href="http://www.lawa.org/welcome_lax.aspx?id=4698">Flyaway Non-Stop Bus Service</a> to and from LAX. A shuttlebus is available hourly, with drop-off at the edge of the UCLA campus, approximately a 12-minute walk to the Conference Center. Be careful to choose the shuttle labeled "Westwood" as there are several other destinations serviced by other FlyAway shuttle busses. Besides flyaway, numerous other commercial shuttles, taxi and car rental services are available around the clock at LAX. </p>

							<p>When arriving at the international section of your arrival airport, please note that you may be subject to delays in clearing United States Customs. We are informed that the average time required by Customs and Immigration is between 1 to 2 hours (and this process often may be longer) before you are permitted to leave the secure area. </p>

							<p>While the principal airport serving this area is LAX, one can also enter the area conveniently by way of <a href="http://www.burbankairport.com">Bob Hope International Airport (BUR)</a> located in Burbank, approximately a half-hour drive from UCLA. An additional airport is <a href="http://www.lgb.org">Long Beach Airport (LGB)</a>, a little over a half-hour drive from UCLA. Both are serviced by numerous shuttles and taxis. </p>
